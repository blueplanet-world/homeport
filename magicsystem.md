## Origin
Magic is an inseperatible part of the world, just like physics laws (instead of using sciences people just explain everything with magic in this world, gravity is Earth's magic). Everyone just accepts it as it is, no one ever thinks that it's unrealistic. Some religions believe that a deity of their own granted magic to the world.
## Who gets the magic
As a natural force, magic can be used at first by a a limited number of magicians and then later widely popularized as magical artifacts. Some countries allow all of its citizens to use magic, while some limit magic to a certain group of people. The debate for this is complicated, and the power to control magic further contributes to inequalities in some countries.

Born magic doesn't exist in this world, it all boils down to who learns to use magic well and who doesn't. People often need to go to magic schools to get license for using magic. Outlawed use of magic might get them jailed.

While each country often have magic regulation laws of their own, international magic use is regulated by the [[Aperium]]. These are anointed knights (often called *beekeepers*) that go around to stop governments and international criminals from misusing magic. 
	**The fetchers:** This is the division within the Order who makes sure high-grade artifacts don't go stray. It's their mission to locate and retrieve stray powerful artifacts, since these left alone can create disastrous consequences.  
## How it works
Fundamentally, magic is finding the form for your intention. From this one law, magic has developed into many things within the past few centuries. Currently, there are a few major schools of magic:
- **Elemental:** magic that shifts natural elements such as water, fire, soil,...
- **Script:** also called curse, magic that uses words (whether written or verbally) to deliver intents. By far the most popular form of magic for its application in manufacturing.
	- Scripts can also be used to enhance or curse an existing object. The power of script is limited by the object's magic resistance. The higher this property, the less effect magic has on it. An ideal object needs to have as low resistance as possible.
- **Formation:** considered an advanced form of Elemental where the user could extract elements from an object and use these element to form something else. So far, not a lot of people use this as it's still in research. The best known pracititioner is its founder Rostafr Nibelund.
	- **Alchemy** is believed to be the early form of Formation. Alchemy was greatly disregarded as a real magic practice as its outcomes were inferior to other forms of magic.
