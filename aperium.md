# The Magic Safety Commission (or Aperium)
The Magic Safety Commission is an international organization forseeing magic regulation across continents. It is their job to make sure governments and individuals abide to the law so that no international magic feuds happen.

## Magical Artifact Retrieving Division
Also called "the fetchers" for short, this division is in charge of locating and retrieving lost high-grade artifacts. In case the artifacts' owner has passed away or doesn't want the artifact, it is also their duty to seal, destroy, or bring the artifact back to Aperium's headquarter for safekeeping.
