### Minorities
Apart from the Wriscks, Otterfolks are also native to this land. Modern Wrisckaria and Wrisck people have done a lot of work on their racism towards Otterfolks, but in the past Otterfolks used to be isolated in their own neighborhoods. There is still a lot of activism going on.
## Architecture
Wrisck buildings are short and sturdy to withstand the cold. Their rooftops are steep so snow falls off easily. The Wriscks are proud of their brickmaking, so little paint is used to show off the natural color of the bricks. 
### Arts & Craft

- **Embroidery** is taught to every child as it's considered a character building skill. A common pattern for beginner is the pinecone.
- **Leathermaking** is also an important craft, as the Wrysck culture values sturdy material that they could use for a lifetime.
### Calendar
Wrysckaria follows the common calendar. They don't celebrate Midsummer as there is hardly a difference between early summer and mid-summer in Wrysckaria. However, their Spring festival has to be the biggest on the continent.
- **Spring Day:** A week-long festival to celebrate the arrival of spring. It doesn't have a concrete timeframe, celebration starts as soon as snow has molten completely. People party at townsquares and there are usually parades. 
- **Midnight Sun Festival:** The winter solstice festival for the Wryscks. On this day, they usually get zero sunlight, and they usually light up an artificial sun to wish for a warm spring. A cozy time to be with family and closed ones.
